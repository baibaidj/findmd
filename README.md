I've worked in medical facilitation industry for more than two years and tried to search for 
therapies and doctors around the world especially in the US for patients with sever and rare diseases, 
such as cancer and Bronchiolitis Obliterans. I think it will be worthwhile to share what I've found on github. 
I may only encounter these diseases once in a life time. Yet the information on the diseases and specialists may be 
extremely helpful for those patients who want to seek treatment internationally.
